# Creating a Repository  
A repository is like another word for a project. From the main page of GitHub you can create a repository by clicking this button 
circled in the image below. 
You can choose whether to create a public (anyone can see it) or private (only people you choose can view and edit) repository.

You can also create a repository by selecting this button located on the left side of the image above, or you can click on the dropdown box on
your profile picture located in the top right corner, then select "Your Repository" and select the same green button located towards the upper right side.

Be sure to check the box that says "initalize this repository with Add a README file" since this file will be what gives developers information regarding what your project is about.  
  
  # Editing a Repository

  Once you've created a repository, you can create a **branch** for your files to go in, this is found circled in **blue** in the image above.
  A branch named "main" is there by default, this is the definitive branch for your repository. 
  When a new branch is started, it’ll be a copy of the master branch until you edit it to make new changes. 
  You can work on several different branches in order to make edits before committing them to the main branch.  
    
  You can **add new files** by clicking "Add File", found circled in **pink** in the image above.
  You can choose which branch you would like your new file added to.  
    
  To make changes to a branch, go to code view and select the file you wish to edit then select the pencil icon in the right corner. 
  Make your changes then at the bottom you'll find a commit message, where you can explain your edits, then to save your changes
  click "commit changes".  
    
  When collaborating with others, for a branch to be merged with another person's branch a **pull request** must be made. 
  This is seen circled in **orange** in the image above. 
  This is a request to incorporate your changes into their branch. 
  Click the “pull request” tab and select the button that says “new pull request.” 
  Next, in the “example comparisons” box, find the branch you made and review your changes then click the “create pull request” button. 
  Title your pull request and briefly describe the changes you made, and finalize by clicking “create pull request.”
